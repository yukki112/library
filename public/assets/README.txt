Place UI icon images in this folder:

- logo.png             -> System logo (header/login)
- TB.png               -> Dashboard metric: Total Books
- AB1.png              -> Dashboard metric: Available Copies
- BB.png               -> Dashboard metric: Borrowed
- OB.png               -> Dashboard metric: Overdue
- AB2.png              -> Quick action: Add Book
- ABL.png              -> Quick action: Borrow/Return Log
- RLD.png              -> Quick action: Lost/Damaged Report
- IC.png               -> Quick action: Manage Clearance

Notes
- Use square PNGs (64–128px). White glyph on color is ideal.
- Files are referenced from `public` as `assets/<name>.png`.
- If an image is missing, the layout still renders; just drop the files here and refresh.
